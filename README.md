<h3>Pointers</h3>
The content of the location of a pointer variable is an address of another location in memory.<br>

```c
Type *x;
```
This means the content of x must be a pointer(the address) to another location of type Type.<br>
To access the content of location which x points we write:
```c
*x
```
